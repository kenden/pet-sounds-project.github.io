The goal of this project is to collect the way animal sounds are represented in writing in different languages 
and present this in an attractive fashion.

Neither the concept of "represented in writing" is clear nor what "attractive" means. 

Personally, I am uncertain pretty much about any detail regarding the realization of this project and place 
full confidence in the wisdom of the crowd. I guess this is going to be an evolutionary and incremental process 
of 
* collecting the data
* refining the logical structure of its presentation
* refining the visual structure of its presentation

Specifically tricky is the question regarding how to communicate the pronunciation from one to another language.
There is an [international phonetic alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) but
maybe just using links to audio recordings or a semi-accurate transcription into English will do the job as well.
